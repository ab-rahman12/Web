    <p>Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a clever chicken named Clucky.
Clucky wasn’t like other chickens. While the others spent their days pecking at the ground, Clucky spent her time… thinking.

One day, the farmer decided to sell Clucky at the market.
But Clucky overheard him and said to herself,

“Nope! I’m not ending up in someone’s soup!”

That night, she sneaked into the farmer’s house, found his smartphone, and ordered a taxi on “ChickenCab” app (don’t ask how she typed with her wings 😆).

When the taxi arrived, the driver looked confused and said,

“Uh... you’re a chicken.”
Clucky replied confidently,
“Yes, but a paying chicken. Let’s go!”

The driver shrugged and drove her straight to the city.
There, Clucky opened a fried chicken restaurant called “Cluck Donald’s.”

When the farmer saw the restaurant on TV, he couldn’t believe his eyes.
He shouted,

“That’s my chicken!”

But Clucky looked straight into the camera and said,

“Not anymore. Now I’m the boss!”</p>
